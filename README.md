## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes wildfire damage data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) and builds a structured pipeline to predict structure damage severity under wildfire conditions.

The task is formulated as a binary classification problem, identifying whether a structure is "Destroyed (>50%)".

This project demonstrates how data quality, exploratory analysis, and machine learning can be combined into a structured analytics workflow for real-world decision support.

## 📄 Data Quality & EDA Outputs

This project includes detailed data quality analysis and cleaning strategies:

-  [Data Quality Report](reports/Data%20Quality%20Report.pdf): identifies key issues such as missing values, high cardinality, inconsistent formatting, and long-tail distributions  
-  [Data Quality Plan](reports/Data%20Quality%20Plan.pdf): documents feature-level decisions for cleaning, imputation, and transformation  

These reports capture the reasoning behind data preprocessing and feature engineering decisions, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

### EDA Insights

EDA and modeling reveal that:
- Mobile homes show significantly higher destruction rates
- Structural and material features interact with environmental factors
- Temporal features contribute strongly due to interaction effects

This highlights the importance of combining statistical analysis with model-based interpretation.


## 🤖 Modeling Results

### Model Comparison (Test Set)

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score | AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Baseline (Always 1) | 0.579    | 0.579     | 1.000  | 0.733    | —   |
| Linear Regression   | 0.819    | 0.855     | 0.826  | 0.840    | —   |
| Logistic Regression | 0.822    | 0.894     | 0.785  | 0.836    | 0.91|
| Random Forest       | 0.836    | 0.861     | 0.853  | 0.857    | 0.92|

All results are evaluated on a held-out test set, where Random Forest achieves the best balance across precision, recall, and F1-score and is selected for further optimization.

### Final Model & Optimization

We further optimized Random Forest through feature selection:

- Full model: **151 features → F1 ≈ 0.893**
- Reduced model: **45 features → F1 ≈ 0.891**

The final model is **Random Forest (v4-2, 45 features)**:
- Reduces feature count by ~70%
- Maintains nearly identical performance
- Improves efficiency and interpretability

This demonstrates that feature selection enables significant model simplification without sacrificing predictive performance, making the model more suitable for real-world deployment.

### EDA vs Model Insights

EDA captures individual feature effects, while the model captures interactions, highlighting complementary perspectives in understanding wildfire damage risk.
